# Truck Workspace

A local-first PWA combining Truck Work Diary and the truck Invoice Generator. Version **2.0.0-beta.2**. The APS Carpenter invoice app is not included.

## Run and build

Node 24 is used by CI.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

`dist/` is the complete HTTPS-hosted application. It works at a domain root or a repository subpath. Opening `index.html` directly as a local file does not provide PWA or secure browser APIs.

## Features

- Driving timer with saved sessions, base-time-zone handling, quarter-hour rounding and start correction.
- Separate Work and Rest rows with 24-column diary blocks, recorded work-cap highlights, page/window totals, tap/drag selection, precise/overnight ranges, Undo and full stationary-rest entry.
- Change locations, odometers, rest classifications, daily checks, driver snapshots and paper-page photos.
- Book-aware page jumps, automatic page allocation, cancelled snapshots and skipped-page records.
- Original paper-style graph with a complete detail appendix; 7/14/28-day statistics and as-of review.
- Truck invoice v14 layout, fixed C/O rates, overrides, miscellaneous rows, reviewed diary trips, revisions, PDF, real XLSX and CSV exports.
- Original two-page safe-driving / daily-check form, optional branding, saved driver details and reusable signatures. New trips start with fresh inspection/declaration answers. Signed forms are retained as read-only records.
- Text/table notes, tags, favourites, masking and optional AES-GCM encryption of note contents.
- Combined backups with checksum validation, optional passphrase encryption, legacy diary and truck-invoice imports, merge/replace preview and an atomic pre-import recovery checkpoint.
- Offline app caching and staged updates. App cache and personal records are separate.

## Architecture

`src/domain` contains the typed data model and pure diary, invoice, form, migration and hours-review logic. `src/storage.ts` uses IndexedDB transactions with revision checks; `src/context.tsx` serializes UI mutations. A failed transaction cannot replace the previously committed workspace. Another tab cannot silently overwrite a newer revision.

`src/screens` contains the compact React screens. `src/documents` renders the original layouts, PDF pages and XLSX files. Hours calculations run in a worker. Screens and PDF generation load on demand; all production chunks are included in the offline cache.

Driver identity is captured on diary days and timer events. Paper pages have separate IDs and book/number mappings, so cancellation retains a snapshot while a replacement can refer to the same date. Issued invoices and signed forms retain their contents; new revisions/trips have separate IDs.

## Beta 2 changes

Documents holds PDF/JPG/PNG/WebP files offline (8 MB per file, 24 MB total), with expiry dates and pinning. Full backups include the files. Existing installations upgrade their IndexedDB store in place; document bytes are kept separately from frequently saved diary records.

Forms support signing directly and optionally saving that signature. Invoice Load Details and Miscellaneous use the original table columns; saved business/customer/bank defaults can be collapsed. Dates display as dd/mm/yyyy and times as 24-hour driver-base time, with the system picker used while editing. Historical diary and new-form base settings are retained.

Red work blocks identify recorded work-cap exceedances supported by the existing helper. They are not a complete fatigue-breach or truck-safety determination; rest-pattern checks remain in Stats/Driving. The offline truck-route idea is preserved in `ROADMAP.md` and is not included in this release.

## Restoring old records

Records → Restore backup accepts diary schemas 62/63, older compatible full-slot diaries, truck invoice v14 backups, and this app’s combined backup. Nothing is imported until the review step. Merge keeps existing records on conflicting dates or IDs. Replace affects only the selected backup’s module, or the whole workspace for a combined backup. An active timer must be finished before a diary replacement/import.

The old compact diary treated omitted dates as rest. The migration preserves that interpretation within the bounded saved history, marks imported days for review, and retains the original import. Dates outside that history remain unrecorded. An old active timer is retained in the source import for review, rather than restarted from an uncertain legacy clock. Combined backups preserve the new timer exactly.

Same-browser legacy recovery uses the old `truckDiaryPWA` and `aps_invoice_generator_v1` keys only when requested. It leaves those keys intact. Data on another domain, browser, or device requires an exported backup.

## Hours guidance and release limits

This is a **personal record and review tool, not an NHVR-approved Electronic Work Diary**. Keep the required written diary or approved EWD. The helper covers Standard/BFM solo and two-up work-cap and rest-pattern checks. Missing history, unreviewed imports, rule/base changes and daylight-saving days require review. AFM and ACH remain certificate-specific, record-only modes; WA/NT rules are not implemented.

Passing the automated suite is not regulatory certification. Physical iPhone Safari/PWA, Android, actual GPS, native PDF sharing and representative real-backup acceptance remain release checks. See `VERIFICATION.md` for observed evidence and open gates. Production publication is a separate, manually dispatched workflow.

## Privacy and retention

There is no analytics, server account or cloud record upload. Explicit current-location lookup sends coordinates directly to [BigDataCloud](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/docs/article/why-is-reverse-geocoding-api-free), under its client-side policy. Manual and saved places work without it.

Unencrypted records, notes, photos and signatures are local browser data. Masking only hides screen contents. Optional note encryption protects the note body/table; titles and tags remain visible. Encrypted backups protect the entire export. Passphrases are never saved and cannot be recovered. Previously exported unencrypted files remain readable.

Browser storage can be cleared or evicted; exported backups remain essential for retention. No routine automatically deletes diary records. Native sharing opens the device’s share sheet when file sharing is supported; otherwise the app downloads the PDF for attachment.

## Deployment

The `Build and test` workflow validates source and uploads a `truck-workspace-build` artifact. The `Publish reviewed production build` workflow is manual and deploys the tested `dist/` artifact through GitHub Pages Actions. Configure Pages to use GitHub Actions before production promotion; the TypeScript source directory is not a static Pages artifact.

The legacy application remains available in Git history at `1b040348eded789ab9fdb33e0d5c1c5329485acd`. Do not copy real driver backups, signatures, PINs, licences or bank details into this public repository.
